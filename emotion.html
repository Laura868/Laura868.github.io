				<li>I started by decontextualising an object, giving it another view. This could somehow remind us Duchamp, if we take a look into the art world.</li>
				<li>In other words, I could say that I am interested in portraying the invisible or, more accurately, those things not seen at first glance</li>
				<li>I was inspired by Duane Michael´s philoshophy, wich is based on the irrelevance of a true perspective of reality. His work reflects the misleading nature of photography, giving primacy to emotions. Accordingly, there is not a single palpable reality but many, depending on the point of view.</li>
				<li>As Duane Michael´s said " When the photo is able to mark the viewer trough their own experience</li>
				<li>I am offering images of conventional elements from diferent perspective, arousing emotions not conditioned by an object in itself, but rather through a less usual point of view that evokes an unusual meaning</li>
				<li>My visual references are Edward Weston and abstract photography</li>

		<h6>Personal Project</h6>
		<p>I began with the concept of human emotions, and to give shape to this idea I decided to work with abstract photographs suggesting emotions captured on postcards.</p>
		<p>I wish to give people "one emotion for each day", not a conditioned emotion but one that depends on the viewer's mood, impacting on what the image on the card evokes. I only added a word on each card, in order for the emotion to be a positive one. </p>
		<p>I thought these cards needed a place to be kept, and this place at the same time could be part of the project. The idea was to make a box, similar to the ones used in casinos, where cards come out one by one. In this way, I could play with the viewer's curiosity.</p>
		<p>The box's system works by turning a handle, producing then a card through a small opening. Spectators would then have an emotion in their hands, or rather a way to activate an emotion.</p>
