                                <p><strong>2nd option: </strong>The gradual price change was noticed more often (it can be because of knowing the scenario from the first option)</p>

                               <p><strong>Options 1 & 2:</strong> All participants mentioned the importance of images, simple and clear flow to follow as well as good visibility of the reviews (reviews were important trigger for the purchase).</p>

                               <p><strong>2nd option:</strong>  It wasn’t obvious that it was possible to click on each option in the summary list to be able to change it;
</p>
                                <p><strong>2nd option:</strong> 3/6 participants were confused by seeing the ‘Curtains personalizer’ CTA below the summary list of options. They thought they needed to do something more to be able to continue instead understand if was in case they would want to edit the list;</p>
                                <p><strong>Option 1: </strong>It wasn’t obvious for some participants that the price in the sticky menu was dinamically changing (might be due to prototype constrictions);</p>
                               <p><strong>Options 1 & 2:</strong> Even almost all the participants noticed the “learn more” link. They still mentioned their expectations were to see not only the text but also some pictures/videos within to learn more about each option;</p>

                            <p><strong>How do customers choose?</strong></p>

                               <p>Usually, customers have an idea of what they want to buy (in terms of colour, measurements, type etc.), they try to compare the image that they have in their minds with the items online or in store</p>

                            <p><strong>Would anything make the process easier for customers?</strong></p>

                               <p>-All participant’s ideas are around some guidance or facilities that could make them sure that the curtains and/or blinds will fit them;</p>

                                 <p>-To have a demo room with options to choose from room types (e.g. nursery, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom etc.) different tips on how to be able to install curtains or blinds, and to see how they may look and feel;</p>

                                 <p>- To be able to see and touch the product unrolled;</p>
                                 <p>- To have specific assistance from the person who has knowledge about process of installation, about fabrics, colours and correct measurements.</p>

                                 <p><strong>Do customers need a visualizer or would it be a simple configuration piece, such as a calculator?</strong></p>

                               <p>Assumption from research is that customers do like visualizer like something that is nice to have. However, most participants described what they observed in other visualiser was like not real and admitted that to have many images and/or videos of the product could help even better than visualizer.
                                </p>

                                 <p>-The need to visualise is based on the need to understand how the product would look like and on the fear that it can be totally different in real life (from colour, texture, fabric or other options perspective);</p>

                                 <p>- The research showed that users can rely on images/photos proposed by the website if there are many of them and of good quality, with different scales and angles. The option to order a free sample mitigates the pain about fabric quality.</p>

                                <p>Based on all the above, a final design was created where a progressive disclosure allowed the customers to go through the personalisation process in a seamless and non-overwhelming manner. Instead, of adding a CTA to go to the personalised process. The page was divided with a title that let the user know where they were to go to embark on the personalisation journey, so, all could be on the same page but thanks to the progressive disclosure in small chunks. The business was asked about an option to upsell with an insurance option that will bring peace of mind regarding any mistakes with measurements, keeping in mind the bespoke items are not refundable (it is still a pending query). To make the user more aware of the non-refundable policy, they have to make action by ticking a box before committing to purchase. Better images and videos with options for detailed zooming were requested to be added, but if not possible, the user still had the option to ask for a free sample to be delivered to their home. The user can see at the end of the process a summary list with all the bits of personalisation. In click, it scrolls the user back to the correspondent add-on in case they have a last-minute decision in any changes. There were also some talks about the delivery process. The business request was thought to be only click and collect. Though would be nice to have home delivery as it can be a relatively heavy item, and the collection in store might be good for people with a car, but not so much for the ones using the public transport. Giving choices to the customer is always the ideal. </p>

                        <p>The National Autistic Society estimates that there are around 700,000 people on the autistic spectrum in UK more than 1 in 100 people. Families included, autism is a part of daily life for 2.8 million people. 
                            Autistic children tend to have communication problems and challenges in expressing their emotions. 
                            Teachers in various autistic schools admit finding it challenging to get and maintain the attention of their students. These teachers also have limited teaching tools (e.g. PECS and TEACCH) most of which are paper-based.
                            There is, therefore, a gap in the market for technology-enhanced teaching tools  like the Emoti-C-on application.

                        <p>The project would be launched as an e-learning app/ platform for teachers' use to enhance social skills and empathy in autistic children. Focused mainly on emotions, it is a highly customizable application which provides a personalized learning plan, empowering children to take an active part in their own learning. It involves pairing illustrated emotions using a facial expression recognition system with the appropriate scenarios. The app also enhances positive social reinforcement, as it provides some gaming experience in which the children have to coordinate and communicate their actions with a partner.

                        <p>The National Autistic Society estimates that there are around 700,000 people on the autistic spectrum in UK more than 1 in 100 people. Families included, autism is a part of daily life for 2.8 million people. 
                            Autistic children tend to have communication problems and challenges in expressing their emotions. 
                            Teachers in various autistic schools admit finding it challenging to get and maintain the attention of their students. These teachers also have limited teaching tools (e.g. PECS and TEACCH) most of which are paper-based.
                            There is, therefore, a gap in the market for technology-enhanced teaching tools  like the Emoti-C-on application.

                        <p>The project would be launched as an e-learning app/ platform for teachers' use to enhance social skills and empathy in autistic children. Focused mainly on emotions, it is a highly customizable application which provides a personalized learning plan, empowering children to take an active part in their own learning. It involves pairing illustrated emotions using a facial expression recognition system with the appropriate scenarios. The app also enhances positive social reinforcement, as it provides some gaming experience in which the children have to coordinate and communicate their actions with a partner.
