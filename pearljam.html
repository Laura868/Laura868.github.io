		<h6>Album Cover Redesign</h6>
		<p>The current album's cover art, photographed by Ament, features a black-and-white picture of a sheep from a farm in Hamilton, Montana. According to Ament, the cover was a representation of how the band felt at the time, with Ament stating "we were slaves."</p>
		<p>With this redesign I wanted to continue with this concept of "SLAVERY", in this case depicting the band as slaves of fame and society.</p>
		<p>In order to give shape to this idea, I decided to play with a light bulb as symbol of the brightness of fame. But the symbol becomes its opposite when you see a figure locked inside it trying to escape, while the crowd welcomes and feeds the persistence of this feeling. </p>
		<p>At the same time, I wanted to convey motion and strength by giving the light bulb movement, as well as representing the agitation of the mass, moving to the music inside the record. At the same time, I employed worn colours and letters characteristic of the grunge style.</p>
