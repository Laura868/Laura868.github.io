		<h6>Flyer</h6>
		<p>For this project, I worked mainly in line with the existing brand. Throughout the process, I have always been looking at their website in order to create a flyer according to the design on their web, a modern, clean and adaptive design easily portable to different formats.</p>
		<p>I have created several options, and I would like to show you 3 of them. However, if I had to choose I would pick the first one. I think it is more modern than the rest and all the information is set on one page engaging the viewer in a unique and easy way. I have used the brand's colours to further ingrain their message, considering colour as a means to expose the message I am promoting.</p>
		<p>I have added icons to convey the message and make the text more entertaining, and I have also tried to follow the principle of `less is moreÂ´ so as to inspire readers with just about enough information to get them to want know more about the company. I have finally used a call to action, encouraging the audience to discover the website and get them involved more closely in the process.</p>
		<p>The difference between the first and last options is that, while both convey a more modern design than the second one, the last one has a back and front image, making it more expensive to print.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, taking into account the printing process, I have produced them to be printed on 150 gr matte coated paper. The method used could be both digital or offset, depending on the number of flyers.</p>
